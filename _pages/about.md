# About Me
* I am Research Fellow in the [Machine Teaching group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html) at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), advised by Dr. [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
