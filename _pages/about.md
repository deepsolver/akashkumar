# About Me
* I am Research Fellow in the [Machine Teaching group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html) at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), advised by Dr. [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in **deep learning**, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.

# Recent News
* Participated in **The Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School**, 2020 organized virtually at MPI-SWS from 2-8 Aug.
* Participated in **Directions in ML: AutoML and Automating Algorithms** Lecture series starting 28th July, 2020 by Microsoft Research which features talks by outstanding academics and domain experts.
* Two papers submitted at the Proc. of the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS'20), 2020
